Variables and Placeholders

The optimization process serves to tune the parameters of some given model. For
that purpose, TensorFlow uses special objects called Variables.

Variables can hold the weights and biases throughout the session
* Must initialize your variables 
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

Placeholders - empty at first. data is fed into it in small batches
needs to know the type of data and shape 
*  You may not know the number of samples in your data so its 
common to see this below 
pt = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=(None,5))
