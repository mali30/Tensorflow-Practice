A perceptron is a artifical neuron 
It has inputs and outputs
Inputs will be values of features
Inputs are then multiplied by weights
* Weights are randon numbers

The results are then passed to an Activation Function

Now what if the inputs are 0? Anything mulitplied by 0 will be 0.
* To fix this we add a bias term.

Mathmatically it looks like this

from i=0 to n wi * xi + b
wi - weight * input 1
xi - weight * input 2
b - bias
