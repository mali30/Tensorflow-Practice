Cross Function - a way to measure how wrong we are

y - represents the true value
a - represents the neurons prediction

w*x + b = z 
pass z into our activation function

Quadratic Cost
* Larger errors are more prominent do to the squaring
* Unfortunately this calculation can slow down our learning speed 

Cross Entropy
* Faster learning
* The larger the difference the faster the neuron can learn
