Supervised Learning - uses labeled data to predict a label given some features

If the label is continuous its called a regression problem, if its categorical it is called a classification problem.

Classification - 
Features: Heights and Weights
Label : Gender

Task: Given a person's height and wiehgt, predict their gender

Regression
Features: Square Footage, Rooms
Label: House Price

Task: Given a house's size and number of rooms, predict the selling price


Unsuperivsed Learning
Clustering- Features no Labels

Features: Height and Weight
Label: ? 

Reinforcement Learning

Agent-Learning/Decision Maker
Environment - What Agent interacts with
Actions - What the Agent can do


Steps for Supervised Learning:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Cleaning
3. Test-Train Split
4. Train Model on Train Set
5. Evaluate Model on Test Set
6. Adjust Model Parameters
7. Deploy Model

Steps for Unsupervised Learning:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Cleaning
3. Train 
4. Train Mode
5. Evaluate Model
6. Deploy Model


Hold Out Sets:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Cleaning
3. Holdout-Test-Train Split
4. Train Model on Train Set
5. Evaluate Model on Test Set
6. Adjust Model Parameters
7. Deploy Model(Test against Holdout)
* Holdout is final metric test against model since it's never seen the data and no paramters adjusted for it.
